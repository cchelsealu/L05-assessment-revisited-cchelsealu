## Overview

The main goal of this lab is to have students think more about performance metrics, especially those used for classification.

## Instructions

After creating a github repo and connecting it to RStudio, students should work through the instructions provided in `LO5_assessment_revisited.html`. A template is provided (rename as lastname_firstname_L05.qmd).

Students will need to submit their rendered html file which should contain a link to their github repo. See canvas for submission details.
